## the swanky bojo

- an experimental handwired 3d printed keyboard

#### random facts

- can be printed without support
- can be printed on a bambulab a1 256x256 printer
- m5 screws - 2x 23mm / 3x 20mm
- inspired by le chiffre and geist totem keyboards
- i used one key pcbs because i am a bad soldering noob
- was made entirely in tinkercad
- 3d files could be better in many aspects, e.g. would be great if the top could be printed upside down for the hice pei printer plate finish....
